# Additional Reserved Tokens

Token reserved for possible future use or to avoid potential parsing ambiguities:

- Backtick (for potential macro/quoted forms)
- Leading `.` followed by ident (kept for possible meta operators)â€”current list literal form uses `.{`, so no collision.
- `:::` triple colon (avoid accidental namespace inventing)
- /> </ (pipe and reverse pipe operators)
- @id (decorator/attribute syntax)
