# Proposal Workspace

Draft and experimental specifications live here. Mirror the main `spec/` layout so each proposal sits beside its eventual home:

- `core/` — language semantics drafts.
- `runtime/` — runtime and ABI experiments.
- `tools/` — compiler, formatter, and build tooling proposals.
- `sugar/` — syntactic sugar explorations.
- `emit/` and other subdirectories as needed.

Once a proposal is accepted, move its content into the corresponding location under `spec/` and remove the draft from this tree.
